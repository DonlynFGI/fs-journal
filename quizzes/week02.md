# Intro to JavaScript

**1.** Which keywords are used to declare a variable in JavaScript?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

let, var, const

```
**2.** What is the definition of a function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
a block of code that is saved in memory for use later
```
**3.** What are the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```


solid is the ideology that every function preforms one specific task. we use this to both simplify and add efficiency to our code. in other words, don't build more than one task into one function, build a function for each individual task.

**4.** Given this array: 
```js
let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple',  'orange', 'strawberry']
``` 
What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
two, because arrays start at zero.
```
**5.** With these two objects: 
```js
let you = { name:"You", hair: true, friends: [] }
let them = { name:"Them", hair: false, friends: [] }
```
how would you .push the `them` object into the `you` object's array of friends?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
you.friends += them
```

**6.** Give an example of a JavaScript `Conditional`:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
>= greater than or equal to
```
**7.** In the `for loop` below, what is the name of the piece belongs inside the empty "______" space? What would you put here to increase `i` by one on every iteration?
```js
for ( let i = 0; i < arr.length; _______ ) {
  //...
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
i++, because we're adding one to I every iteration
```
**8.** What does the `DOM` acronym stand for? Which file is first accessed to render the `DOM`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Document Object Model, the html will be accessed first to structure the page
```

**9.** What are the `9` ECMAScript types as defined by MDN?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

Cannot find these anywhere. Does this involve articles in journals? Because those still don't work on my end.

```
**10.** When it comes to functions or methods, what is the difference between a `parameter` and an `argument`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 A parameter is used to define a value that is passed through the function, an argument defines a variable that can be used by any code
```
**11.** What is the difference between a `primitive` value and a `reference` value?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A primitive value is basic, built in operands whereas a reference value refers to a specific value in a complex action.
