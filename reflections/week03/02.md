## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

to bundle and restrict access to data from outside.

people used to mark things that they wanted to keep private from the user with underscores, which caused issues in refering to them, with changes that were made breaking code entirely, and a large amount of people were ignoring it.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?


using class field specification and classes, by declaring something a constant. so that the user is unable to modify that variable in code.
