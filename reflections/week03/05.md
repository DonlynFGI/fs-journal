# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
almost none of my projects went well. this new format is killing me. fortunately thursday's group project was easy because my partner killed it.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
that soon enough this new format will get easier. I was told about view a little early, and I'm excited to learn it.
- What are you struggling with?
Everything MVC, I'm having a lot of issues figuring out what goes where and when.
- What would you count as a victory?
passing today's checkpoint with no strikes added to my record.
