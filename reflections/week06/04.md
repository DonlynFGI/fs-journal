## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

A nested route allows complex ui components nested inside each other

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

When building apps that require data inside other data to be formatted differently and sent to a different file location. i.e. modals inside modals that route to a function not in the top level modal's file path.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

yes, when parameters passed need to go to a file seperate than the parent's route.
