## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?


I can't find this information anywhere, so I'm guessing simple, single-line, and complex. I'm also not certain what differs in the way they act.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?


parameters are a placeholder for a value. arguments are a value passed between multiple different types of code written.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?


A function that can take a function as input or even output a function. 
a few examples include: map() split() join() find() reduce()
