## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

scope is a method of understanding when and where we can access or refer to variables.

2. What is Hoisting ?

hoisting is the idea of moving our declarations to the very top of the scope layout, for the purpose of always having them defined before any actions using them are executed.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?


var isn't going to be used for the most part, because it assigns values globally so that all functions can access.

let is used when you want to assign a variable with a value that is used in a context-sensitive way, in that you can use the same variable name multiple times and assign it different values in different functions.

const is used to define a value that cannot be changed, for something that needs to be a constant value throughout your code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Javascript was built in a week, and it definitely shows that. I'm also taking away that I'll be using javascript quite frequently, so I should get as familiar with it as possible.
