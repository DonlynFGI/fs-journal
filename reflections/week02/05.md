# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Slapgame and rockpaperscissors went surprisingly well. I was ecstatic when they worked.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

That for the most part js is easy, and html is too when you really get bootstrap down.

- What are you struggling with?

using audio files, playing audio on an action, some of the classroom concepts like the Math. operation and making a cart that submits the form data

- What would you count as a victory?

Finishing slapGame, finishing RockPaperScissors, having my last checkpoint regraded properly and having the strike removed because of it. Getting the links in my journals working (finally) (with assistance from mark)
