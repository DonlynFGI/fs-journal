> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?


Pyramid-type structure, assuming that line one's code stops running at line two.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?


Asynchronous means "to be used in the future" or "take some time"
it's involved with callbacks because they are typically used for Input/Output tasks and need to be executed at a specific time in the code.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`


Keep your code light and well-detailed. Use modules whenever possible/necessary. Go through and manage every error until the file is seamless.
