## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?


Async is used to make code asyncronous. Await only works on asynchronous code, and basically tells the code to wait for something specific to occur.

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?


Make the code asynchronous, specify the promise to wait for, specify the action afterwards.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

It's more simplistic to use than other methods, we use significantly less code than we would writing a timeout, works functionally better than guessing with time.
